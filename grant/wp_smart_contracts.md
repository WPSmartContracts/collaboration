### Development Roadmap

#### Milestone 1 - Free Software for WordPress Community
Free and Open Source Smart Contracts Deployment for WordPress Users

For the future of WP Smart Contracts, we propose a step towards advancing accessibility and transparency in blockchain integration within the WordPress ecosystem.

* Expansion to New Networks: We will expand support to include additional networks through a grant-based approach, ensuring strategic and sustainable growth.

* Availability of Zilhive for Current WP Smart Contracts User Base: Current WordPress installations with the active plugin will automatically receive updates, including the addition of new networks for free. This includes free deployment for life, thereby exposing the network to a broader user base of freelancers, entrepreneurs, and developers.

* Free Smart Contract Deployment: As part of this milestone, the new networks will be available for free deployment within the plugin backend. Site administrators will only pay for the gas fee, benefiting the WordPress freelancers and developers community.

* Full Opening of the WP Smart Contracts Code: The addition of new networks will require new smart contracts factory code, which will be fully open-sourced. Coupled with the existing open-source PHP code within the plugin itself and the open-source nature of the generated smart contracts, this ensures that the plugin comprises entirely open-sourced code for new networks.

* Smart Contracts Audits: New smart contracts factories will undergo comprehensive audits by our internal team and a third-party team, mirroring the audit processes employed in previous rounds.

* Website, Documentation, and WordPress Plugin Setup: Documentation of the new Free plugin features will be provided.

By pursuing these Milestone 1 objectives, WP Smart Contracts aims to position itself as a leader in promoting accessibility, transparency, and innovation in blockchain integration for WordPress users.

#### Milestone 2 - Beyond WordPress
Free Smart Contracts Launcher For Everyone

This milestone expands our reach beyond the WordPress ecosystem, catering to users who may not have expertise in WordPress but seek to deploy smart contracts.

* Smart Contracts Free Launcher: As part of Milestone 2, the new networks will be available in the Smart Contracts Free Launcher. This launcher serves as a public platform where users, regardless of their familiarity with WordPress, can effortlessly deploy any available smart contract.

* Public and Replicable Launcher: The Smart Contracts launcher will be publicly accessible and replicable, enabling installation by any user utilizing the WordPress plugin. Consequently, website users will have the freedom to deploy smart contracts at their discretion.

* Exclusive Launchers for Your Network: The Launcher can be set to work exclusively with chosen networks, allowing site owners to create an exclusive launcher for their preferred network.

* Open Smart Contracts Launcher: The public launcher will operate similarly to the current launcher, but it will be free to use for Zilhive users, with users only required to cover gas fees. Additionally, the networks integrated into the plugin will be openly accessible for deployment.

* Multiple Language Support: All new features will be available in 10 languages: Arabic, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish.
